# leaf-health-analysis-svm
Developed a machine learning model to analyze and predict the health status of leaves using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. This project aimed to provide an efficient solution for early detection of plant diseases, thereby aiding in timely intervention and improved crop management.
