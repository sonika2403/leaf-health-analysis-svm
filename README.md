Developed a machine learning model to analyze and predict the health status of leaves using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. This project aimed to provide an efficient solution for early detection of plant diseases, thereby aiding in timely intervention and improved crop management. 
Key Responsibilities

1. Collected and preprocessed leaf image data to create a comprehensive dataset for training and testing.
2. Implemented feature extraction techniques to derive meaningful features from leaf images.
Developed and fine-tuned Naive Bayes and SVM models to classify leaves as healthy or diseased.
3.Conducted comparative analysis to evaluate the performance of both algorithms in terms of accuracy, 
 precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Visualized the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves to highlight the effectiveness of the models.
5. Documented the project process, findings, and future recommendations in a detailed report.

Tools and Technologies used: 
1. Python
2. Scikit-learn
3. OpenCV
4. Kaggle Notebook
5. Pandas and NumPy

Achievements: 
1. Achieved an accuracy of [X]% with the Naive Bayes model and [Y]% with the SVM model.
2. Demonstrated the potential of machine learning techniques in agricultural technology and plant disease management.
